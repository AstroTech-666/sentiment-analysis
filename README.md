# Sentiment Analysis Web App

This web application uses a pre-trained machine learning model to perform sentiment analysis on text input. It classifies text as **positive**, **neutral**, or **negative**, and provides visual feedback with emojis. Additionally, there's an interactive "blinking emoji" effect that corresponds to the sentiment of the text entered.

## Features

- **Sentiment Analysis**: Classifies the sentiment of the text as **positive**, **negative**, or **neutral**.
- **Interactive Emoji Blinker**: Based on the sentiment, an emoji blinks at a speed determined by user actions.
- **Simple and Responsive UI**: Clean, modern design with a user-friendly experience.

## Technologies Used

- **Python** (Flask) for the back-end web framework
- **Torch** and **Transformers** for sentiment analysis using a pre-trained Roberta model
- **HTML/CSS** for front-end design and user interface
- **JavaScript** for emoji blinking effect functionality

## How to Run the App

### Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Flask
- PyTorch
- Transformers

### Installation Steps
